## Feedback & Contributing

Feel free to file an issue. Feature requests are welcome, however, they need to be discussed and we cannot guarantee that everything will be implemented. Therefore, preparing a detailed RFC (request for changes) is a good idea. If you wish to contribute, please take a quick look at the CONTRIBUTING.md guide.
